			<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Peter Principle</h4>
			<p>
				I do not know much about the Canadian hierarchologist, Laurence Peter, 
				but my recently discovery of one of his ideas has solved one of my fundamental and long-held questions.
				I am honestly embarrased that it turns out that it is this simple,
				but I am still a very young man and have not yet had to fully interact with the hellscape that is the corporate ladder.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here is the description of the Peter principle taken from wikipedia,
				as I must admit that my style of writing can exacerbate already esoteric topics.
			</p>

			<p><i>
				"The Peter principle states that a person who is competent at their job will earn a promotion to a position that requires different skills.
				If the promoted person lacks the skills required for the new role, they will be incompetent at the new level, and will not be promoted again.
				If the person is competent in the new role, they will be promoted again and will continue to be promoted until reaching a level at which they are incompetent.
				Being incompetent, the individual will not qualify for promotion again, and so will remain stuck at this final placement or Peter's plateau."
			</i></p>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Corporate Structure in Action</h4>
			<p>
				There are a variety of things that are caused by corporate structures, 
				but the main two -- in relation to the Peter Principle -- are namely:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Development of any learning skills are completely impeded</strong>. 
					Employers do not promote primarily on the basis of competence [both skills, knowledge, experience, and sociability]. 
					If competence is not the primary selection factor, then it implies that other factors are being selected for.
					Competence is the only essential quality which matters in the workplace.
					If you were to remove the quality of competence from the substance of a particular worker
					and perfected all other qualities -- only the qualities, of course, which do not interfere with the quality of competence --
					you still would not have a viable worker because they are still incompetent.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Exceptional people can no longer be understood.</strong>
					I previously worked for a large company as a summer student writing Visual Basic macros and pushing paperwork,
					when I stumbled upon a large security issue. 
					I brought this issue up with the head of IT, 
					who never replied to any of my messages or emails.
					The only person who actually seemed interested in helping is the senior IT specialist.
					I then starting building a demo-virus with an empty payload so that we can see if my security speculations were true.
					They were.
					The resulting damage from this virus could have been in the billions of dollars, 
					and would affect the jobs of thousands of people.
					To this very day it has never fixed.
					I reported and built a fully functioning virus that is capable of destroying a multi-billion trans-national corporation in my first month on the job.
					The senior IT specialist was no help, as in his own words "you probably know more than the head of corporate IT."
					Now obviously I am not that good
					as cyber security is probably my weakest field in the domain of computer science,
					but the very fact that I did this and nobody at the company could even compare shows you how incompetent people are.
					Why am I a summer student printing, stamping, and emailing paperwork when I could be solving this real problem?
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">In Relation to Parents</h4>
			<p>
				Now you are probably asking why I titled this post <i>"Your Parents are Failures"</i>,
				and if you don't understand where I am going with this,
				you are already a victim of what I am about to explain.
				Before you were born, your parents had two or three decades to themselves before deciding to bring you into this world.
				You and your parents are both affected equally by the two previous points I mentioned earlier, 
				but you suffer a far worse fate.
				All those consequences that should have only affected your parents ultimately affect you, as you are a product of their upbringing.
				Now I shouldn't have to spell this out, but if your parents are mindless drones who are incapable of complex thought, 
				then how can you expect a child to reasonably develop from an environment with almost no educational value.
			</p>

			<p>
				This might sound really sad to hear now, but you are most likely just like your parents; 
				a plane without thrust or ailerons can't help but be encapsulated in a ball of flame.
				But do not fret, as there is some good news to tell you! 
				The very fact that you made it this far proves that you can survive this.
				Unfortunately, there is some bad news.
				I have always had an insatiable appetite for knowledge, the universe, and Delta,
				which leaves me utterly clueless as to why other people aren't.
				Hopefully you can find out yourself.
