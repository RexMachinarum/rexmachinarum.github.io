				I originally wrote this as a message to one of my close friends, 
				and I didn't put a ton of time into considering altervative approaches.
				Rather I was trying to emphasize in a larger conversation that people rarely are capable of thinking outside of well established norms,
				and ultimately this is one of the greatest hinderances to humanity's development.
				This blog post is on the site to serve as a test of my website's initial commit,
				and I assure that my future blog posts will be more rigorous.

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h4>
			<p>
				I just noticed an issue with Git.
				I was thinking about a hypothetical project that has a bunch of other libraries written in my language.
				When you git clone the repo you aren't going to get any of these unless you use submodules.
			</p>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">Solution with Submodules?</h4>
			<p>
				So you would do the obvious git submodule add <span style="font-family: courier">https://&lt;URL_TO_REPO&gt; &lt;LOCATION&gt; &amp;&amp; git submodule update</span>,
				and this would download the proper repositories from the internet.
				Now the problem with this is that you are downloading the entire repo,
				and not actually just the library that you want (so all the build, interal docs, etc etc).
				On github you solve this issue by making releases,
				that are basically just zip files and then downloading them and adding them to your project.
			</p>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">Solution with Releases?</h4>
			<p>
				But now you have another problem. The files that you downloaded are local to your projects repo,
				and aren't pulled from the internet so if a security update comes out you are fucked because you have to go track down the new updates everytime that they happen and for every repo.
				If you write a script to do this you now have to manage another program AND it most likely isn't cross platform either.
			</p>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">Solution with Branches?</h4>
			<p>
				Now you could try to solve this with branches and a script on your system. When you want to make a release of your library, use a script on your local system that creates a new branch called like RELEASE-X.X and then push only what is needed to your thing, and have a cron job on your local system that detects if these new packages have come out. This obviously sucks because now every project has to become a distributed system just to edit code.
			</p>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">Final Solution?</h4>
			<p>
				Literally just let git track files that aren't on the local machine.
				You already rely on the internet for access to libraries, so why not just pull them from the internet?
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-family: courier;">
				# creates a zip file at lib/file.zip</br>
				git add --url ftp://www.something.com/lib.zip lib/file.zip</br>
				# unzips the file at lib/</br>
				git add --url ftp://www.something.com/lib.zip lib</br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Man it is actually crazy that most people don't have good enough intuition to save their life.
