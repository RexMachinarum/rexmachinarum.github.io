			<p>
				Hi, I'm Réx, and welcome to my personal website. 
				This site is currently heavily under construction,
				but I plan to add a blog as soon as possible.
				I will add some links to my public-facing social media once I upload a video or two to YouTube.

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">About Myself</h4>
			<p>
				I am a hobbyist in both a variety of domains at a variety of skill levels: 
				Latin [lingua latína], linguistics, mathematics, geometry, computer science, and philosophy.
				I am currently developing a collection of software that consists of:
				a transpiler and interpreter for a custom programming language,
				a multiplatform and powerful build system for ANSI compliant C89,
				and a series of research papers on universe simulation via data structures and universal actors.
			</p>
			<p>
				All of the things I have listed off are at varying stages of development and usability.
				The multiplatform build system, for example, is already capable of being used almost bug free for the compiler,
				but I can't guarantee it is even close to perfect yet.
				The universe simulation is the most speculative of any of these projects,
				as it primarily exists as a bunch of single-feature prototypes.
				This in all in hope to flesh out a potential system that is even more viable than my current ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, I do understand that most people coming to check out my site will never have a fraction of the computer knowledge that I have,
				and that is completely understandable.
				If you want to read more about these projects, 
				please check out my Github and my blog posts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason that all of my projects are currently programming based has a novel explanation.
				The world, as far as we know, behaves naturalistically
				(operating on principles -- for example, the law of gravity -- which are consistent over time and space, and acts in the same manner as long as the same substances are being acted upon)
				and computers are one of the only ways for massive amounts of quick naturalistic simulation to occur.
				Essentially, what I am proposing is that computers allow you to create simplified universes,
				as they consist of matter (data) and operating principles or laws (code).
			</p>
			<p>
				If we are able to create small universes in computers, 
				then we are able to study very fundamental concepts in philosophical fields such as ontology.
				This is a result of both universes sharing the same essence -- being comprised of matter and laws which operate on the matter --, 
				but this microverse has a simplified substance, and therefore less factors must be considered to determine if a quality is essential or not.
